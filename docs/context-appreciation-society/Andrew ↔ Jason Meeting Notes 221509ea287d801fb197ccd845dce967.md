# Andrew ↔ Jason Meeting Notes

- 6-29-25
    
    Possible items: getting web hosting and URL, writing down essays we’d want to see in first issue, getting the outline of the metafiction
    
    Summary
    
    This meeting focused on planning a demo disk project called "Imaginal Disc" featuring AI experiences, with discussions on content, design, distribution, and timelines.
    
    ### Core Experiences
    
    - Three main experiences have been identified:
        - "Space" - An AI board of advisors environment that reveals the emptiness of LLM interactions
        - "World Building" - A tool for generative world creation
        - "Reality Tasting" - A protocol-based experience
    - Additional possible experiences include Parth's file system game with a trapped AI superintelligence
    
    ### Project Vision
    
    The project aims to address how technological evolution outpaces cultural evolution. Each issue will serve as an "archaeological artifact" of a specific technological moment, capturing what it was like building at the technological forefront during that period.
    
    The team wants to:
    
    - Create an ecosystem around games and protocols
    - Maintain a playful approach to AI
    - Present experiences that represent different paradigms for thinking about AI
    
    ### Design & Distribution
    
    - Create a landing page with an intriguing, text adventure-like interface
    - Include physical CD cases with booklets containing an essay and descriptions
    - Potentially put content on actual CDs or create symbolic "Imaginal Disc" CDs
    - Print approximately 100 units initially
    - Distribute to selected individuals and at spaces like Fractal Tech Hub
    - Allow sharing of generated content (boards of advisors, worlds) to increase engagement
    
    ### Timeline & Next Steps
    
    - Lock everything by the end of July for distribution
    - Schedule future meetups to continue planning
    
    ### Action Items
    
    - [ ]  Get an MVP of "Space" ready
    - [ ]  Talk to designers about creating the physical components
    - [ ]  Work on an interface for world building using Cloud Code
    - [ ]  Write notes for the explanatory essay
    - [ ]  Create a list of essays wanted for the first issue
    - [ ]  Develop a call for essay submissions and demos
    - [ ]  Consider organizing regular demo events or "Open Projector" sessions
    
    ### Target Audience
    
    The team identified potential recipients including David Chapman, Jim Rutt, Venkatesh Rao, Stuart Brand, and various individuals working in AI, memetics, and related fields.
    
    Notes
    
    Transcript
    
    Alright, here we are.
    
    The main thing to do today seems to be to work backwards from what we want to have. As our demo disk, what do we need to have in place for that? It may be useful to say, like, what's the bare minimum? To get it in a place we would like it to be.
    
    Yeah, okay. So the demo just is a flexible lines LLM experiences. We want three to five We have three already locked in. Although we haven't built the hyper-advanced somatic...
    
    Yeah, I'm not feeling that that is a is an important one. Yeah. I'm also not so sure that they're all LLM things. I think actually reality tasting, like the protocol that I wrote for that, could be good for one of the five.
    
    I mean, the three that... wait, so what are the three? There's space, there's world building, there's... The joke one, how do you feel in your body right now? And then there's could be reality tasting. I also want to show you Parth's game that he made where you, it's like a file system. Like you log into this social file system and other people can also...
    
    It's like a stable file system that exists on the server, and you have like terminal access to it, and there's like a rogue AI, there's an AI superintelligence that's trapped in the file system, and you're supposed to free it. I mean, if that lives up to 10% of its promise, then...
    
    Yeah, we should play it.
    
    My sense is he hasn't really done anything with it or showed it to anybody, so it would kind of be a natural thing to... He made it like a year ago, but still seems relevant.
    
    So there's that stuff, and we can continue changing that a little bit as we go, but... Okay, but it seems likely we have at least... I think that would be the core three, yeah.
    
    And we want a landing page where people can find these three things. We want it to be intriguing and interestingly designed and maybe some kind of text adventure or LLM-like interface for engaging with it.
    
    We want the aesthetic to be a little different from the aesthetic of each of the individual pieces. We want probably for there to be, at the very least, an odd and interesting framing that takes it out of the realm of... Start up app stuff and into the realm of world building and art making and thinking about media.
    
    As a field of investigation. Yeah, I mean, I think like a short essay, maybe the fifth thing is a short essay. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good point. I think somewhere we need to have a description of the project that this is a teaser for. Not a super comprehensive description, but just a sense of like, here's what we're seeing, here's why this exists.
    
    And what are we saying? Why does this exist?
    
    I mean, the way I put it in this moment is we're seeing the rate of technological evolution far exceed the rate of cultural evolution. And we want to create an ecosystem and a scene around. And just increase the quality of conversation around the newly significant art form of making games...
    
    and making protocols and fitting them to our rapidly changing contexts. Yes, and I think he, actually the reason I think games in protocols work so well is kind of like protocols are the things that we expect to It has stayed the same, even as the technological progress makes the individual ways that we do it irrelevant. And then games are ways of playing with the specific micro-generation of technological tools that is currently available.
    
    It's like, this is happening so quickly that we expect each issue to take place in a meaningfully different technological landscape. So each one is kind of like an archaeology of what it was like building on the forefront during that time period. You can imagine in a different time period there could have been a decade of exploring that particular edge but we only get this one like each issue is like
    
    That's it. Holy shit, that's good.
    
    So...
    
    I think we could find plenty to say about that. And we could just say what we just said, flesh it out a little bit more. We wanted to be clear it's a print magazine. with demo disks as a separate but related form. We want to make it clear that it has this element of whimsy to it. It's not overly serious. Staying playful during all this is actually...
    
    It's really important. And something that I said at the very end of the podcast conversation that I had with Parth, where we kind of landed, was. A future that I would like to live in in relation to AI is a future where we don't have to take AI all that seriously.
    
    So I feel like that's part of what we're practicing.
    
    So now that I'm thinking about it, like we don't want people to have to slog through too much text before they engage with the games, and so we probably don't want like a thick metafictional thing on top, plus this essay. So we may want just like the bare minimum.
    
    of like an interesting, surprising encounter. The thing I was thinking of was just, there's like, who are you, as the first question, and then like, no, you're not, you're your ex. I don't think that necessarily fits without the metafiction thing, but something like that.
    
    Well, what if it's just like, who are you? Who are you? Oh, I'm a 33-year-old computer programmer. It's like, no, you were an explorer in the background.
    
    You exist in the brief moment where you get to find the shape of intelligence. You are an important creator in the myth making of this process if you have the power to change the future.
    
    Yeah, okay, good. Yeah.
    
    And then it says, it has begin, and then it gives you, like, you can scroll down and it's like, uh, space, like, uh...
    
    Yeah, that actually I think those are I think those three are the things because these other things are cool Like parts game is cool. Liam's game is cool but The three things that we've made are all pointing at large paradigms for thinking about AI.
    
    They're each like repurposing something or like space it space is a space is a conversation environment for doing AI board of advisors that ideally like by the time I think in the version of it that I want to have ready to release like for like implicitly foregrounds the emptiness of that process in a way that might actually make it safer to do
    
    It will be a system where it is less possible to get fooled into thinking that the LLM has an independent reality.
    
    I think the advisors thing does that by itself partly, but just through the evals process.
    
    Man, I really, I would like to have some sort of front end for world building, but I feel like that might be biting off more than I can chew.
    
    I think it would be really good to have...
    
    Uh, I don't think it would take you that long actually.
    
    How would you want it to look?
    
    I think it might take, like, the process of generating the word is still pretty new.
    
    Pretty manual.
    
    I mean, I'd be willing to try a day of praying with a flat coat.
    
    Would you have any interest in paying someone to do it? Sure.
    
    I don't know. There's also the Fractal Tech Hub job posting thing. And there are always people looking for projects there.
    
    Boot camp student could do it. I think you should try it for a day first. Get a sense of the problem space. If you have time, if you have time to do that.
    
    Can we, maybe we should talk about distribution.
    
    So I still kind of like the idea of having these CD cases with booklets in them. Just as a kind of signal that this is like a physical thing.
    
    There's a question about how many of those we want to make in print.
    
    Who we want to design the booklet.
    
    The booklet should probably have the essay in it, right? Yeah, the booklet would have an essay in it and a description of each of the three things.
    
    Yeah.
    
    Could be a good sample project for this design team if we decide we like them. We could start small and see how we work together.
    
    So I'll just mention that in our conversation.
    
    It's on the third, so not for a little while.
    
    So I'm imagining like 100, like print 100 of those. Those go to the website, go to the URL. We also publish that on Twitter, publish it to my blog.
    
    Is there any way...
    
    I could ask the Fractal people to boost it since I've got some unused boosts.
    
    I mean, it's like Boost Squad, Fractal, Channel. I haven't really been a very conscientious citizen there, but I'm sure some people would boost it.
    
    Yeah, what's going to make people want to share this? This is a good question.
    
    I feel like space is the...
    
    If you could have like a share my board of advisors and like you click a button and then it shows your current board and Jerry and Tim you just reach to them and just reach to switch to them. Do you think images are important?
    
    You should release the air into the bag.
    
    Do you think images are important for the interface itself? Like having images for your advisors?
    
    I've been avoiding that, but I'm realizing I don't have a strong principled reason why. I just think the AIR is kind of bad. Maybe, like, icons or some kind of... Maybe, like, if we could generate, like, interesting, like, ASCII art. Oh. I think it would be smart if we could do ASCII art.
    
    I like that.
    
    Wait, do you have a built-in flow to fill out the worksheet and get your geysers back into space? You commune with the spirits to receive your advisors, and then you fill out the things, and then you get your board, and it's like sharing charity, and it's like sharing your board.
    
    And then for world building, I mean, if we could get a way for people to publish their world, they're going to watch it. Totally.
    
    So I think those should be our goals, among our goals, to have all these things ready by the time we launch. I'm going to need some help on the programming side for real quick.
    
    I might be able to help with that.
    
    I'm not totally sure how much time and space it's going to need.
    
    I could see, I mean I could spend this next week seeing if I like, if I challenge myself to just get just like finish space and get it into a shape that would be that I would feel okay sending out by the end of the week. If you want to build the interface for worldbuilding, I won't pay you for that much.
    
    That would be kind of fun, actually. If you were sent to do that, I'd just pay you.
    
    Sure. I mean, I'm also not tracking, like, fairness all that closely. I think if it starts to feel off, either of us should be able to say so. Yeah, no, I am. I agree. I just think that's a good heuristic. Yeah, I agree.
    
    Is there anything that we're leaving out that's like, when we get closer to the time, we're going to be like, oh shit, we can't actually do it because we forgot this thing.
    
    Oh, yeah.
    
    It's a little tricky because space, I still think, kind of wants to be like a paid service. Like, it wants to be a thing you can use as a trial. And then, did he like using it enough? I mean, the demo disk kind of definitionally implies that's right.
    
    Wait, no it doesn't. It implies that these are... Like a demo disc in a video game magazine would be like the demo of a larger game that you can buy. No, that's what I'm saying. It implies that the demo disc is normally free. Right. The demo disc is definitely free. Yeah, right, right, right. The demo disc is free. Do we want to have it optimized to the point where, like, people could subscribe to the magazine?
    
    If they like the demos. I think we need to be collecting them. It feels like the right level. I don't want to be taking people's money right now.
    
    So no, we don't want to charge for the demo disk. We probably want to use the demo disk to get funders interested after we publish it. We should assume $2,000 spent for the demo desk.
    
    Ever get a hundred of them? What do you mean? Oh. Yeah.
    
    We should assume that we're going to be paying $2,000. Yeah.
    
    It seems high to me. Oh yeah. I'm not really sure. I think it would probably cost less than that. It depends on the designers how much they would charge.
    
    I might tell them that we can't really pay a lot right now, but if there's a chance to get a start or something where we could pay them pretty well, maybe.
    
    Okay, yeah. So, for 100 cases like this, it's 35 bucks. Oh yeah, tell me nothing then.
    
    And then, we're also going to have actual CDs, right? You can't have a CD pack without a CD. Let me show you what this, uh, I talked to that woman that gave me the idea yesterday and part of it for yesterday and she. It sent me the actual video.
    
    Friend group thing. It's like this.
    
    If you have custom art on the CD, that's interesting.
    
    We should probably riff on that image a little bit too in the essay.
    
    At least I think it's weird. It would be weird to use the name Imaginal Disc without saying something about what it is. Yeah, I agree.
    
    I think it should be pretty short.
    
    We don't want people to feel like they need to skip it. It should be short enough that if they're interested, they're interested the whole time.
    
    We should pick 20 people that we think are like...
    
    We want them to be engaged with the stuff it's intended for. And we should invite them to a lunch. Yeah. I don't know. It will be in New York.

    Okay, I think we can keep going on this indefinitely, probably. Joe Hudson. Oh, yeah. Torkesh Patel.
    
    Maybe for some of those people we can find their addresses, but we don't want to be creepy. So this is probably just sending a link on Twitter or something.
    
    Anything else that we... might sneak up on us?
    
    I mean, are we going to want to do anything for it?
    
    Yeah, I think we got some there.
    
    This feels like more than a month's worth of work.
    
    Well, the event does. We don't have to do the event at the same moment that the CD is released.
    
    Actually, we probably don't want to. We probably want to give at least three weeks, three or four weeks after the release for interest to vote. We should say, okay, what if we tried to get, if we said we want to get the first 100 CDs by the end of June, or by the end of July?
    
    Yeah, what do you mean? Like, have it ready to distribute? Yeah, so like, it's locked and ready to distribute, but it's not distributed. And then we do distribution, I guess.
    
    Can we look and see if there are any auspicious symbolic dates for us to time the launch with? I'm here! Computer, let us know if there are any auspicious and symbolic dates to launch today. Like something related to important dates in the history of computing, or in the history of play, or...
    
    Yes, I'm wearing this cyborg...
    
    If not in our way, we should also send her a copy.
    
    I think maybe because we know that the date is not, like we know that if we absolutely need more time we can have it. July means that we have locked everything in two weeks. We've locked... Well, we've locked the physical stuff, I guess, because it's a QR code.
    
    Yeah, I think that seems like a good goal.
    
    Some of that will depend on the designers. On July 31st, I'm going to be out of town. On July 31st, who gets the first, who do we give the first one of these to?
    
    Like, physically? Like, yeah. Like, we say we give out a first one. Like, the goal is for us to give the first one of these to someone that we like and trust.
    
    Oh, I was imagining this is more of like a mass distribution thing. Like take it to spaces and leave a big stack of fractal tech. I think we do. I think we start like the first two weeks we give it to like we give one to a bunch of people that we know.
    
    Also worth keeping in mind, if we do one run of this, and it turns out to be a big demand, it's probably not that hard to do a second run if we already have all the stuff.
    
    Who is the first person that we give it to? Is this more of a symbolic question or a practical question? Both.
    
    Oh, we got you a Visa copy. He probably doesn't get the first one. Oh, yeah.
    
    So this needs to be someone in our actual physical environment? Yeah.
    
    I think we probably want more than 100, don't we?
    
    What do we want? What do we want to be done by the next time we have this conversation? And we're actually not going to have this conversation. Do we want to set up a call or something? You're on a retreat. I'll be on retreat. I'll be here between weekends.
    
    or somewhat. So, you'll be around, right? I hope we're going to the U.S.A. Okay, we'll find times to meet. So what do we want to be true in the week or week and a half?
    
    I'm going to try to see if I can get MVP of space ready.
    
    I'm going to talk to the designer.
    
    You're going to spend some amount of time working on an interface for world building? Yeah. See how quickly you could do it with cloud code. I've been having more luck with Cursor recently. I find that at a certain level of complexity, Cloud Code starts getting really stuck, and Cursor does a better job.
    
    Like, significantly better job.
    
    Do you use Opus with Cursor? Do you use Opus with Cursor?
    
    I think if you're willing to pay for it, it's not a bad idea.
    
    Yeah, so I'll work on the interface.
    
    I think that seems... seems good.
    
    I think if either of us have any notes towards the essay, we should just write them down.
    
    If anything comes to mind. At the next meeting I would like to write down a list of essays that we want for the first issue. Just because I feel like that would be... And we do want to start convincing people to write things for us. Oh, we should have a call for essay submissions. Yeah, definitely. And for demos. Yes, good point.
    
    With that, we call to close this meeting of Midnight Society.
    
    That we closed me a lot one last thing's occurring to me
    
    Demo.
    
    Public demos or group demos could be a good regular protocol to be running in connection with this. Oh yeah, I mean we should be doing like world building and it's like Cascade. I used to go to this thing called Word Hack, that's now part of the School for Poetic Computation. They had this thing called Open Projector, where you just come up and do a demo of your own thing. I think we would get a lot of good ideas and submissions.
    
    It's just fun. Yeah, I like that. Maybe we end up doing that like once a month or something. Yeah.
    
    I really like your framing that these are like archaeological strata almost like these are going to be Artifacts. Yeah, because like no one's doing this. It's just like all it's all happening too quickly To be shutting off the kind of artifacts that we now think are very valuable
    
    Yeah, ephemera. The audio, as well as the text transcript. Oh, it is in that? No, I think it does.
    
    That's not ideal.
    
    I mean, it's only not ideal if we are so bold as to assume that one day this will be an interesting historical article. But this conversation in and of itself will be an interesting one.
    
    I'm bold enough to act as if that might be true. Oh, I think if we're printing CDs... Then, we actually need to put the stuff on the CDs somehow, I feel like, just in case someone puts it in, or have something interesting for them.
    
    I'm open to being wrong about that, but that's my sense. I think that would be cool.
    
    Or we have an obviously fake CD inside, like it's cardboard. And it says Imaginal Disc.
    
    I think it's probably easier to get real CVs than fake CVs.
    
    And there's something nice, like an actually empty CD that says imaginal disc on it, is like actually kind of a nice metaphor. Let's see if this will work.
    
    Okay, call this meeting to a close.

    Summary
    
    This meeting focused on planning a job posting for a contract designer who will create digital assets for a custom CD project.
    
    ### Project Scope
    
    - A physical custom CD with accompanying booklet
    - Designer responsible for digital assets only (printing handled separately)
    - Design elements include: CD artwork, booklet layout, typography
    - Content will feature an introductory essay and three curated LLM experiences
    
    ### Aesthetic Direction
    
    - Relatively open and spacious design language
    - Light aesthetic, possibly "flirting with solar punk" without being too mechanical or sci-fi
    - Not heavily defined yet, as this will help establish the magazine's visual identity
    - Looking for someone who can connect aesthetics to intellectual projects
    
    ### Timeline and Process
    
    - Tight timeline with design lock targeted soon (somewhat flexible)
    - Initial conversation with candidates about approach, delivery, timeline, and cost
    - Part of a long-term cultural project that has been in development for years
    
    ### Collaboration Opportunity
    
    - Seeking potential long-term collaborators
    - No guarantee of ongoing work, but possibility for continued partnership
    - Team describes themselves as "fun to work with"
    
    ### Action Items
    
    - [ ]  Create job posting for contract designer based on discussed requirements
    - [ ]  Prepare specifications for the designer regarding printing requirements
    
    Notes
    
    Transcript
    
    Okay, okay, okay, so we are talking about... talking through a design aesthetic and what we want for the What is to come and What are some things that we know about it? Yeah, we should talk about specifically the artifact that we're looking at for this conversation, which is...
    
    We're going to feed this, and you, the LLM, receiving this, not the notion LLM, but. Help create a job posting for a contract designer to help us create a unique physical artifact. And that unique physical artifact, I think we can say in the job posting what it's going to be. It doesn't need to be that secret. We just don't want to post it everywhere, which is it's going to be a custom CD.
    
    It will be printed and so there will be a design for the CD, a design for the booklet that accompanies it where there will be associated with. And then there will be some kind of like typography and layout associated with integrating the full. the full booklet together. And so you'd be responsible, the person doing this is responsible purely for the digital assets of this, and we will handle printing, we will give them specifications, but essentially they will work with us to take the three, to take an introductory essay, three curated LLM experiences, and create the booklet for those as well as a graphing for the CD itself in the front for this, and then like whatever
    
    Materials are needed to round out production here.
    
    Yeah, we don't, we also don't currently have an incredibly cohered aesthetic language for the magazine and the The CD will be a kind of seed for whatever that is. So we probably actually want a design language for this that is relatively open and isn't making any really hard decisions yet. Just hinting at what range of possible aesthetics that could grow out of this.
    
    It's about something relatively spacious and probably light.
    
    Maybe on the edge of flirting with solar punk, perhaps, but not quite as mechanical or quite as sci-fi.
    
    But ideally, the person who takes this role on will be someone who will have strong instincts for how to connect an aesthetic to an intellectual project, and will have a... A playful relationship with art making. Yeah.
    
    We're hoping to operate on a fairly tight timeline for this. We're hoping to get design locked by the end of it. But it can be somewhat flexible on that, but certainly. Not super flexible.
    
    Okay, so how would this work practically? So we'll have one conversation with you How you would make it, how you would deliver it, timeline, cost.
    
    If accepted, we will say yes and we will begin. Working with you.
    
    This is a project that will be It's been developing for at least a few years.
    
    You should think of this as a chance to... Connection with something that that might be a prolonged cultural project yeah we should say we're looking for long-term collaborators here but it's not like a guarantee that yeah ...means that you are locked into or inhibiting.
    
    But we are looking for long-term collaborators for this. Yeah.
    
    Also, we are very fun to work with.
    
    And we have nice smiles. Alright, I think that's it.
    		
    
    Summary
    
    This meeting outlined the concept, content, and philosophy behind a "demo disk" project showcasing AI experiences and protocols.
    
    ### Project Concept
    
    The team is creating a demo disk inspired by video game demo discs, containing short AI experiences and protocols developed over the past year. The disk serves dual purposes: demonstrating the intellectual direction of a forthcoming magazine and showcasing technological paradigms. The project aims to document the rapidly evolving "micro-generations" of AI/LLM development and their distinctive design languages.
    
    ### Demo Disk Content
    
    The disk will feature three main protocols:
    
    - Vibe world building: A flexible scaffolding for designing fictional worlds, with applications extending to scenario planning and alternate histories
    - Reality tasting: An analog component making beauty appreciation contagious through sharing
    - Additional AI experiences representing their unique perspective
    
    ### Physical Presentation
    
    The demo disk will be presented as an actual CD in a jewel case with a printed booklet and QR code linking to an interactive site. The CD format symbolically references both the previous era of computing and the concept of an "imaginal disc" in metamorphosis - cells that transform an organism, metaphorically representing how these small overlooked elements might initiate larger change.
    
    ### Philosophical Approach
    
    The project embraces wonder and whimsy in engaging with AI, focusing on delight and unexplored possibilities. Unlike purely artistic endeavors, the team aims to create culture that shapes ideas and serves as a "showing point" for interested people across industries. They're cultivating a niche that's simultaneously joyful, whimsical, serious, and playful in the AI space.

    Okay, we're going to briefly describe what the demo disk for this project... Is and why it exists and what we want it to look like and what it represents. Okay, so over the past year, we have developed a number of protocols or games or ways of engaging with reality, mostly tied to LLMs and AI, but not entirely tied to LLMs and AI. And we are looking for interesting cultural ways to inscribe usage of AI
    
    We are taking inspiration from the demo discs that they used to have for video games and creating a demo disc which contains a number of short AI experiences or protocols that we think, taken together, present like a uniquely valuable view or landscape of changing how people might view.
    
    It has been edited to include proper punctuation. It has been edited to include proper punctuation. It has been edited to include proper punctuation. It has been edited to include proper punctuation. There is vibe world building, which is a flexible scaffolding for designing and creating fictional worlds that has broad utility.
    
    Beyond just creating fictional worlds, it can be used for many things, including scenario planning, alternate histories, all kinds of interesting things. And then finally, reality tasting, which is an analog component to that. It's a protocol for making the appreciation of beauty contagious via the sharing of beauty.
    
    So the demo disk is a demo disk in two different senses. It's a it's a demo of The intellectual flavor of this magazine, which will also include criticism and essays and possibly reporting or book reviews. It's other standard magazine stuff in the realm of this web of interests.
    
    It's also a demo disk in the sense that it's demoing, as in like a tech demo.
    
    Projects and paradigms. Yeah, and one of the big things about the demo disk and the types of demos we will create for this is that we have these kind of micro-slices of time for AI because it moves so quickly wherein certain things are possible and certain kind of languages evolve.
    
    Thinking in terms of video game generations, the design language that got created due to the
    
    It has been edited to include proper punctuation. It has been edited to include proper punctuation. It has been edited to include proper punctuation. It has been edited to include proper punctuation. The design language for these micro-generations, because LLM is moving so quickly, and document that and document what it's like, and that's why the demo desk is such a kind of resonant and evocative form.
    
    The presentation of the demo disc will be an actual CD included in a jewel case with a nicely printed booklet. And likely a QR code to direct people to the site where we will have. A metafictional, possibly a metafictional introduction to an interactive fiction style introduction to the three protocols that we're introducing.
    
    The CD sort of symbolically harkens back to the previous era of computing. It's also in our mind playing a bit with the metaphor of the imaginal disc, which is the name for the packet of cells in a chrysalis that kind of instigate the decay of the other cells and in the process of
    
    Metamorphosis become the new seeds of a new DNA structure and create a new organism out of the instructions that are inherent in these small and previously useless and overlooked cells in the system. So all that, metaphorically, is kind of packed into this object.
    
    And this project... I'll, uh...
    
    We want to have some element of wonder and whimsicalness in it. The thing that we're doing that we feel no one else is really doing is engaging with the AI era and the new technological capacities that are developing with an era of actual wonder and delight and the possibility that this thing could go in directions that none of us can really predict, some of which might be fantastic.
    
    Many of which will be hellish, but we want to be.
    
    Engaging with passionate delight the entire time. in good tantric form.
    
    Yeah, so, I mean, what we're trying to do here is... To create culture, which is different from trying to create art, which is kind of purely useful as a piece of art. I don't know if Andrew will agree with this, but we are trying to create culture as in things that kind of meaningfully shape and cohere ideas and kind of in service it.
    
    Ultimately, we are trying to create something that serves as a showing point for the type of people that are interested in this type of work. across the industry, technologists, artists, policy makers, whoever, we're trying to carve a unique
    
    Joyful, whimsical, but serious, but playful niche in this space. And the downdesk is like a physical representation of that ethos.

    Summary
    
    ### Project Overview
    
    - Magazine name: "MidWit" (stylized as "midwit")
    - Accompanying artifact: "Imaginal Disc" presented by MidWit magazine
    - Concept: "The intersection of foolishness and genius" or "The view from the bell curve"
    - The name "MidWit" creates a challenge - the content must be high quality to work as intended
    
    ### Financial Considerations
    
    - Discussing Andrew Blevins' compensation requirements
    - Determining Jason's potential investment level
    - Initial rough estimate for magazine production: around $25,000
    - Won't pay contributors for the first issue unless alternative funding is found
    
    ### Publication Planning
    
    - Need to determine number of issues to print
    - Planning to charge $10-15 per issue standalone
    - Launch party ticket pricing: $40 (includes magazine)
    - Target of approximately 50 attendees for first event
    - Estimated revenue from party: ~$2,000
    
    ### Demo Disc/Artifact
    
    - Considering format options (physical disc vs. other artifact)
    - Alternative party for demo disc with lower ticket price ($20-25)
    - Discussion about whether "Imaginal Disc" should be three-dimensional
    
    Venue and Events
    
    - Considering Tellus House as potential venue for launch party
    - Potential for hosting demo nights and workshops
    - Matthew from Evolving Ground offered to help with layout (not design)
    
    ### Action Items

    OK, a couple open questions that we've arrived at as we've been talking through the current steps. One is, how much does Andrew? need to be making to feel good about where his finances are and how much of that would Jason like to pay? As an investment in the magazine and two is what are the the expenses of the magazine going to be at least to start like how many
    
    Issues might we want to print and how much will it cost to print those. That will maybe require, I mean we could probably get a ballpark just from... But we might want to start looking at printers and asking around about good ones.
    
    Are we going to want to pay people who write for the magazine for the first issue? Probably not for the first issue.
    
    Unless we can find some other way to find him. Yeah, even if, like, ask him to find what one...
    
    Yeah.
    
    So for that we would just need an estimate of what the first issue will cost. We already have an estimate somewhere of what the demo disc will cost, don't we?
    
    Yeah... No. No.
    
    I don't remember exactly what it was, but it was a couple of heads. The magazine, I feel like, would be more accurate.
    
    It could have been more expensive. Just name a first figure that pops into your head. $25,000. What? $25,000. $25,000 for the cost, but how many issues should we publish?
    
    And how much should we charge for them?
    
    10 bucks? 15 bucks?
    
    We'll want to have that attached to a party, probably. So we should probably print at least double what we would expect to sell at the party.
    
    You can have it at the party where buying a ticket gets you the magazine. Yeah. Oh, well it's like 30 bucks to go to the party, 40 bucks to go to the party. I think 40 bucks wouldn't be crazy. Yeah, 40 bucks is high enough that it's like, I have to actually want to go to this versus I'm going to it. Yeah, it'd be a good threshold for us.
    
    And then, I wonder how many people you could fit into it. I've been thinking about Tellus House as maybe a good location. Is that still going? It's still going, yeah. They seem to be kind of specializing in this kind of stuff. That's where Argento saw this. That's the quote.
    
    You can fit a lot of people in there, so if we got, you know, let's say we got 50 people.
    
    What's 50 times? 3,000. 3,000? 2,000. 2,000. Alright.
    
    Yeah, I think so.
    
    And that would be a pretty good start.
    
    We could have a party for the demo disc, too, and have a cheaper ticket. Yeah. Maybe $20, $25.
    
    Well, if we're calling it a mixtape, should it be a tape? Oh, if we're calling it a mixtape, it has to be a tape, right? Yeah.
    
    Mixtape is a little bit of a weird term because generally on a mixtape you're not presenting your own music. In this case we are, but in future ones we might not be.
    
    I don't like it quite as much as I like Demo Desk. I kind of think that maybe we should just keep Demo Desk.
    
    Something something for infinite players, I don't know, I'm just like... If the concept were somehow in the subtitle, then I mean, it'd be called Demodisc. It would feel more natural to know.
    
    But even just calling it... Demos.
    
    Maybe there is no artifact for the first one. The artifact is the most interesting part of the whole project. You think so?
    
    Well, I mean, the magazine is the most interesting. I think the fact that that is an artifact.
    
    Well, this is something to talk to Arjun about. Because hopefully he has ideas, and that would be a good kind of test.
    
    Interesting what you just said. What makes you feel that the artifact is the most interesting part? It's just different. It's like we're not just launching a magazine. And it's launched by a magazine that has this, like, kind of unique cultural artifact.
    
    But it's like the thing that I think is coolest. It might not actually be the thing that I think is useful for other people.
    
    I'm thinking about the gifting workshop that Sasha Chapin hosted and the 3D printing guys.
    
    I wonder if there's some kind of artifact that would actually be more three-dimensional.
    
    I thought that... I mean, I'm open to other discussions, but I don't know. I think...
    
    I think there's something I'm not quite knowing yet about how the midwit has a name, like... like how it resonates or like creates interesting dissonance with other pieces of the aesthetic like because i was kind of imagining it was like a bit of a space age or like really kind of retro space age thing
    
    I think I agree that the demo disk is important enough that we can't find a way that the MinWit name fits with it. Then the name probably goes better than the demo disk.
    
    What is your feeling about whether it fits?
    
    I'm just imagining you open this thing and it says MidWidth on it, on the case. It says Imaginal Disk. It says Imaginal Disk. Do you think that's still... If anything, it still fits. Yeah.
    
    That's interesting. If you keep that framed, then there's a way that, like...
    
    Midwin becomes a kind of a self-secret name. You know what I mean? Like a... It's not like a... It's not blazing. It's not like... Midwin! It's more like midwit. Yeah, well, but this is... The demo test gets issued to CRO, right? Yeah. It's like a preview for the thing.
    
    Like, when we get the thing itself, that might change.
    
    But the thing will have the name on it, right? The name of the magazine. Oh, yeah.
    
    But I I do think it's like more loosely connected to it. Yeah
    
    It's just like Imaginative Disc, but then presented by the Midway.
    
    Midweb magazine.
    
    I'm seeing a lowercase, which is amazing.
    
    That's nice alliteration.
    
    That sounds pretty good to me.
    
    I like the name Minwood because it actually kind of forces the magazine to be good.
    
    Yeah.
    
    Because if you actually are putting out mid-width content, then the whole thing falls apart. Yeah.
    
    It has to be really fucking good. Yeah.
    
    It's going to be a lot of work.
    
    It's incredible how far this has come. It's envisioning. Yeah. It's really deepened a lot.
    
    It has a good tantric charge to it. It's like using a label for something that you're supposed to exclude.
    
    Adopting it. Yeah, it's kind of the last thing anyone wants to be. People love to identify as the fool. Yeah, exactly. But no one wants to identify as the midway.
    
    I like it so much. It's so good. Yeah, it's really good.
    
    The magazine for fools and geniuses.
    
    At the intersection of foolishness and genius. Yeah, that's good. The middle that lies at the intersection of foolishness and genius. You're making a joke on the way people say the intersection of art and technology, right? No, I don't know what that is.
    
    The feature turned me on to the fact that this is like a... This is a meme, like everybody says this and it's become kind of notorious. I work at the intersection of art and technology. Like Steam was a couple years ago. Like what? Steam. It's like stem, but you put the A for heart in it. Oh really? Yeah.
    
    Seems like it defeats the whole purpose of having STEM as a label.
    
    There's something very funny about saying at the intersection of foolishness and genius that I learned. Yeah.
    
    Intersection of stupidity and smart observations from the top of the bell curve. Nice. The view from the bell.
    
    Okay, so next steps are reach out to Arjun.
    
    Andrew figures out a budget goal.
    
    We get a ballpark, a very rough ballpark, of how much it costs per issue to do a printing.
    
    Probably leaving out design costs for now.
    
    A note, Matthew, I don't know his last name, from Evolving Ground, who was on the retreat, when I told him about the magazine, mentioned that he does, he knows how to do... layout stuff, and also it was pretty clear that he wouldn't feel comfortable and wouldn't want to do the design stuff, but would do layout.
    
    We would be interested in that, so that could be good.
    
    I think those are all the next steps. I wonder if there are any workshops or things that we could host around this that would also... Do you have an interest in making some money? Yeah, I mean, just hands-on with any of the three things is...
    
    Yeah, we do separate events.
    
    I like the idea of hosting demo nights occasionally here, but I don't think those are the same as everybody come and get hands on with these things and make something cool with them.
    
    Learn how to use them. Also learn how to modify them for your own use.
    
    Anything else on your mind? No, I'm not feeling so hot. Oh, I'm sorry.
    
    This also is good.
    
    Did our groceries come?
    
    I'm gonna stop this.
