# **The Context Appreciation Society: Vision**

The Context Appreciation Society is an open secret society, a meme, an egregore, a murky cabal of powerful beneficent aesthetes, an investment group, and eventually, a physical place where people can hang out, do practices together, and make friends. It is co-created, self-created, nebulous, opinionated, and kind.

**It is a container for at least three things:**

* Midwit Magazine  
* Reality Tasting and similar events  
* A Play Research group

## **Midwit: Equipment for Fluid Minds**

\[Midwit is a working title. It’s good but we might find better.\]

**Midwit** is a quarterly print and digital magazine of blueprints for the AI era. One way of thinking about it is as a magazine of criticism for an art form, and a culture, that does not yet exist. Another way to think about it is as a magazine about interface design, in all the potential meanings of that term.

It combines elements of the *Whole Earth Catalog*, early *Wired*, Erowid, and early video game magazines.

It is also an excuse for weird, genre-bending parties (issue launches).

**Interest Cloud**

Human-computer interaction, nondual meditation, finite & infinite games, AI alignment, American pragmatism, psychogenic design, Pochinko clowning, decentralized education, modern rituals, life-affirming spiritual practice, Christopher Alexander, taking children seriously, taking play seriously,  weird parties, social fabric, embodied computing, cognitive prosthetics, cyborgism, the early East Coast psychedelics scene, Marshall McLuhan, Jacques Tati, memetics, horror, Kegan stages, David Chapman, Stewart Brand, Dynamicland, small group aesthetics, cultural evolution, experience design, road trips, high weirdness, etc. etc. etc.

### **Magazine Sections**

The magazine could have the following **"rubrics,"** or sections:

#### **"Demos"**

Games, apps, interfaces. Compare to the demo disc that used to come with video game magazines. These are experimental protocols that push interaction—human-computer or human-human or human-other—in novel directions.

Over time and with funding, Midwit can provide increasing editorial support for developing projects, using best practices in LLM evals. Contributors benefit both from distribution and from a process that improves their work. 

#### **"Lifeforms"**

Critical appreciations, disappreciations, recommendations, and phenomenological reports—happenings, immersive theater, clown shows, sadhanas, the weird phenomenological effects of prolonged LLM use, paeans to dying industries. The focus here is on what is coming into being, and what is going out of being. Holding beauty before it dies, touching something nascent before it becomes form. Energetic field readings. Culture reporting. Ideally lots of photographs paired with the essays.

#### **"Manual"**

Practical section, teach the reader how to do something. How do I run an LLM on my phone, and why would I want to? How can I create an info agent to filter my information sources? What's an MCP server and why should I care? How do I make the most of a solo MDMA trip? Etc. Compare to sections of the *Whole Earth Catalog*.

#### **“Voices”**

Interviews with inspiring people. Compare to *The Paris Review* interviews with poets and writers. Carefully conducted, edited, deeper and more careful than a podcast conversation. **People who come to mind:**

* Stewart Brand  
* Alan Kay  
* Bret Victor  
* Charlie Awbery  
* David Chapman  
* Misha Glouberman  
* John Vervaeke  
* The Folk Computing guys

#### **"Outputs"**

Interesting artifacts of stochastic computing. Fleeting, ephemeral, recontextualized. Compare to Harper's Magazine's "Readings" section. Jailbreaks, machine poetry, snippets of dialogue. 

#### **Features**

The heart of the magazine. Likely mostly cultural criticism, reporting, and science writing, but the gates are wide for now. **Example essays we have in mind:**

* Considering Stewart Brand's impact on the culture and his relevance to this moment, with an emphasis on the New Games Movement  
* The practice and significance of LLM evals as the site where human agency interacts with powerful AI systems  
* Essay examining the recent resurgence of clowning in American urban culture, its possible relationship to cultural atomism & predictions of neofeudalism  
* Nathan Fielder's *The Rehearsal* as a case study in David Chapman's meta-rationalism  
* The historical lineage behind Folk Computing (Dynamicland etc.), the promise of embodied computing, and why does it keep not happening  
* David Allen's Getting Things Done as a system for bootstrapping Kegan stage development  
* Someone should probably synthesize Tibetan Buddhist demonology with vasocomputation with reports that Internal Family Systems practitioners tend to converge on the view that demons (“parts” that actually hate you & are evil) are ontologically real

#### **Book Reviews**

We may want them. Not clear yet how prominent they’ll be. 

#### **Fiction**

Science fiction or fiction that treats our present moment as science fiction or weird fiction. Probably not a core section, might come in later issues. AI-generated fiction a possibility here. No autofiction.

## **Reality Tasting**

[Reality Tasting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1apmVNSgjeP0G19T5ng7sCfeeNa3rUA4rGNvFnW4dN-k/edit?tab=t.0) is a \~monthly [lecture series](https://partiful.com/e/Yj1vcJTJtkyA2r8fzlLh) where 2-3 people share something they enjoy, and get weirdly specific about how they go about enjoying it. It has included mother–and-son carnatic music performances, slideshows about water droplets, and instructions for enjoying sentences.

Reality Tasting is an *example* of the kind of open-source protocol that might emerge from Midwit. It's also implicitly/subtly a way of discovering powerful protocols of context appreciation, which could blend into essays or creations that the magazine could distribute. It embodies the ethos of the overarching project: curiosity, wonder, and clear-eyed creative engagement with things as they are. 

Hopefully CAS seeds lots of weird party forms like this that can break containment and become their own things.

## **Research Group**

This is the experimental edge of the Context Appreciation Society. It’s a cross between an incubator, a practice group, and a scientific research organization studying the nature, importance, and practice of human play. The group will produce artifacts communicating its findings (to be published in research journals, blog posts, and Midwit), and workshops and classes for sharing powerful practices discovered via play. 

It is also a place for people to go if the ethos of CAS appeals to them—the other pieces of CAS function as a funnel, and vice versa. 

The group will aim to secure funding for its early research (we have one possible donor in mind) and will make it a goal to become **self-sustaining entirely through profitable products within a year**, or else dissolve and write a case study about its learnings.

**Research questions could include:**

* What practices allow modern humans to enter quickly into states of reciprocal opening?  
* What is "fun"?  
* Do we have a fun deficit? If so, how can fun be made cheap and easily accessible for the average American?  
* How can play meaningfully contribute to adult development, e.g. passage through Kegan stage transitions? What are the best meta-protocols for unblocking group patterning through play?  
* New taxonomies of play, games, and play lineages.  
* Meta-instructions for group game creation.  
* What important tacit knowledge do master game makers and game facilitators hold? How could it be distributed or passed down?  
* What happens when we apply the "improving mindset" to play? What makes some play sessions or play practices better than others?  
* How does human play change in the AI era? What protocols or designed membranes might be important to cultivate and preserve human agency? How can group play function as a place to renegotiate definitions and styles of human being?   
* Are there roles for AI systems in mediating, guiding, or enabling human play; if so what might they be and how can we create them? (Midwit can be a place to try such things.)  
* How does play contribute to ecological understandings of the world and context?   
* What is the relationship between the play deficit and the fertility crisis?

**Potential products could include:**

* A "play pattern language" book offering modular building blocks for helping people create their own games and styles of play  
* Play coaching (individual and/or group)  
* Courses and workshops for play facilitators  
* Educational consulting and interventions for schools, organizations, and communities interested in incorporating more play into their culture  
* Card games, board games, game books, etc. (I have a few ideas for these already)  
* A large-scale games festival (see Stewart Brand’s New Games Festival for inspo)

### **Mission & Vision**

The social mission of the research group is to make play accessible, common, and affordable, and to make its significance felt by those who could use more of it. It is also an interface between respectable science and nebulous informal practices, and a way of smuggling the ritual arts into popular culture. Taking a phrase from Venkatesh Rao, one could call this a group creating and disseminating tools and technologies for *rebuilding fun baseload grid capacity*.

The mission will likely adjust over time, mirroring its focus.

**Inspiration/models to look at:**

* Nora Bateson's Warm Data Labs  
* The New Games Movement  
* Play Studies  
* The Ludic Liberation Lab  
* The Alembic (especially the way they've combined neuroscientific research with live nondual meditation practice)  
* The School for Social Design  
* Misha Glouberman's group classes in Toronto
