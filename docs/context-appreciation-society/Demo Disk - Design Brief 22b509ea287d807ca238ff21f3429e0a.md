# Demo Disk - Design Brief

[https://x.com/andrew0blevins/status/1942748979680137617](https://x.com/andrew0blevins/status/1942748979680137617)

## Project Overview

We're creating a demo disk for **Midwit**, a quarterly print and digital magazine of protocols, games, rituals, and tools for the AI era. You can think of it as a magazine of criticism and practice for an art form—and a culture—that does not yet exist.

The demo disk serves two purposes:

1. It's a demo of the intellectual flavor of the magazine (which will also include criticism, essays, reporting, etc.)
2. It's a tech demo—showcasing experimental protocols that push interaction in novel directions

## What We're Making

A physical CD in a jewel case with a professionally designed booklet, containing a QR code and link to:

### Three Core Protocols/Experiences:

1. **SPACE** - An LLM-powered environment for multi-perspectival dialogue, with a unique developmental eval system that lets users “grow” better prompts organically
2. **Vibe World-Building** - A flexible scaffolding for designing fictional worlds, with utility beyond fiction (scenario planning, alternate histories, etc.)
3. **Reality Tasting** - An analog protocol for making the appreciation of beauty contagious via group sharing

(The experiences will be introduced via a light interactive-fiction frame story.)

The CD form symbolically harkens back to a previous era of computing while playing with the metaphor of the “imaginal disc”—those packets of cells in a chrysalis that instigate metamorphosis and create new organisms from previously overlooked instructions.

We don’t expect people to actually run the CD, but we will probably put some kind of Easter egg on there to reward the dedicated reader.

## Design Philosophy

We're looking to engage with the AI era with an attitude of wonder and delight, acknowledging that this could go in directions none of us can predict—some fantastic, many hellish—but maintaining passionate courage and care throughout, in good tantric form.

We want:

- A spacious, relatively light aesthetic
- Perhaps flirting with solarpunk edges, but not quite as sci-fi; perhaps a quality of roughness, organic forms, rhizomatic structures, things bursting out and overgrowing themselves
- Something that captures the feeling of receiving an old video game magazine demo disc, while speaking to our current moment

We're also documenting micro-generations of AI capability as they emerge—capturing the design languages that emerge in brief windows of particular technological constraint when certain things become possible. The magazine and the demo disks will be like time capsules or archaeological strata of rapidly changing techno-cultural forms. So it’s possible that each may have its own distinct design language.

## What We Need

### Deliverables:

- CD surface design
- Booklet design and layout (integrating a short introductory essay + the three protocols)
- Typography and visual language that can seed the magazine's broader aesthetic
- All digital assets needed for production

We would likely use something like the digipaks offered by [this company](https://www.discmakers.com/products/digipaks.asp), however we’re open to other suggestions.

### Timeline:

- Design locked by mid-July
- Some flexibility there, but we're moving quickly

### What We're Looking For:

- Strong instincts for connecting aesthetics to intellectual projects
- A playful relationship with art-making
- Interest in being a long-term collaborator (this project will develop over years)
- Someone who gets that we're creating culture, not just art—meaningfully shaping and cohering aesthetic directions and live possibilities for human interaction, not just cool images
- Web design skills also good, we may want this person to also help design the trailhead site

## About The Magazine

The Aleph combines elements of the Whole Earth Catalog, early Wired, Erowid, and early video game magazines. It's also an excuse for weird, genre-bending parties and cohering an era-defining tech & art scene in New York. One of our core questions is: *What can we do with unprecedented abundance? How can we enjoy it, how can we survive it, and how can we spread it around?* 

Our interest cloud includes: human-computer interaction, nondual meditation, finite & infinite games, AI alignment, psychogenic design, clowning, decentralized education, modern rituals, Christopher Alexander, taking children seriously, taking play seriously, weird parties, embodied computing, cyborgism, Marshall McLuhan, memetics, Kegan stages, Stewart Brand, Dynamicland, cultural evolution, and high weirdness.

## The Aesthetic Challenge

We don't have a fully cohered aesthetic language yet. The CD will be a seed for whatever that becomes. We need a design language that's relatively open, not making hard decisions yet, just hinting at the range of possible aesthetics that could grow from this.

This is ultimately about carving out a unique niche—joyful, but serious, but playful, but intensely caring what happens and trying to be of benefit—in the AI/tech/culture space. The demo disk is a physical representation of that ethos.
