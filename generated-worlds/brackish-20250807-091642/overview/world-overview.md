# Brackish

Brackish is a test world where the boundaries between salt and fresh water create unique environments and civilizations. This world explores the liminal spaces where different elements meet and merge, creating something entirely new.

## Core Concept

In Brackish, the interplay between salt and fresh water has shaped not just the geography, but the very fabric of society, magic, and life itself. Estuaries, salt marshes, and tidal zones are not just geographical featuresâ€”they are the centers of power, culture, and mystery.

## Key Themes

- **Boundaries and Transitions**: The world focuses on spaces where different elements meet
- **Adaptation**: How life and civilization adapt to ever-changing conditions
- **Balance**: The delicate equilibrium between opposing forces
- **Emergence**: New properties and possibilities arising from the mixture of different elements

This serves as a foundation for exploring various worldbuilding concepts and testing different approaches to world development.
