# The Context Appreciation Society: Five Years Hence
*A World of Abundance, Play, and the Great Metamorphosis*

## Overview

By 2030, the Context Appreciation Society has evolved from a nebulous cultural experiment into something far stranger and more vital than its founders Andrew Blevins and Jason Ganz could have imagined. What began as a magazine called *Midwit* and some experimental protocols has become a distributed network of practices, spaces, and communities that fundamentally reshaped how humans interface with an increasingly AI-saturated world.

The Society now exists as a living demonstration that the "meta-crisis" of the late 2020s—the collision between accelerating AI capabilities and cultural evolution's inability to keep pace—could be transmuted into a renaissance of human agency, play, and meaning-making.

## The Great Context Wars (2026-2028)

The period from 2026-2028 became known as the "Great Context Wars"—not a literal conflict, but a cultural and technological battle over who would define the interfaces between human consciousness and artificial intelligence. As LLMs became ubiquitous and more powerful, different factions emerged with competing visions:

- **The Efficiency Maximalists** wanted to optimize every human-AI interaction for productivity
- **The Safety Orthodoxy** sought to constrain AI interfaces to prevent existential risk
- **The Context Appreciation Society** advocated for preserving and expanding human agency through experimental protocols and play

The Society's approach—treating AI interaction as an art form requiring aesthetic judgment, embodied practice, and continuous experimentation—initially seemed quaint. But as AI systems became more capable, their emphasis on "human agency through protocol design" proved prophetic.

## The Imaginal Disc Phenomenon

What started as a demo disk with three experimental AI protocols became the kernel of a cultural transformation. The original Imaginal Disc contained:
- **SPACE**: A board-of-advisors environment that revealed the emptiness of LLM interactions
- **Vibe World-Building**: A flexible scaffolding for designing fictional worlds
- **Reality Tasting**: An analog protocol for making beauty appreciation contagious

By 2030, hundreds of "Imaginal Discs" have been created by communities worldwide, each containing locally-adapted protocols. The disc format—both physical and metaphorical—became a symbol of the Society's core insight: small, overlooked instructions can trigger systemic metamorphosis.

## Current State (2030)

The Context Appreciation Society now operates from several "Appreciation Nodes"—physical spaces that blend co-working, ritual practice, and experimental theater. The flagship location in Brooklyn has become a pilgrimage site for "context appreciators" worldwide.

The Society's influence is felt across domains:
- **AI Development**: Major tech companies now employ "Context Engineers" trained in CAS protocols
- **Education**: Thousands of schools use play-based curricula derived from CAS research
- **Therapy**: "Reality Tasting" has been adapted into therapeutic modalities
- **Urban Planning**: Several cities have implemented "Play Zones" designed using CAS principles

Perhaps most significantly, the Society catalyzed the emergence of "Proto-Post-Scarcity Culture"—communities experimenting with what abundance might look like when filtered through wisdom traditions, play research, and careful attention to context.

## The Temperature Has Been Turned Up

True to the request for high "temperature" creativity, this world embraces the strange. The Context Appreciation Society of 2030 includes:
- Clown councils that mediate AI ethics disputes
- Underground networks of "Protocol Smugglers" preserving human agency practices
- AI systems trained exclusively on transcripts of Reality Tasting sessions
- Entire neighborhoods organized around different "play paradigms"
- A secret society within the secret society, focused on preserving "pre-AI baseline consciousness"
- Ritual technologies that allow groups to temporarily merge cognitive architectures
- The infamous "Midwit Maximum" parties that last for weeks and reshape attendees' epistemologies

This is a world where the boundary between earnest cultural experiment and elaborate performance art has completely dissolved—and where that dissolution turns out to be exactly what was needed.

## Core Questions

- How do humans maintain agency and meaning when AI can outperform them at most cognitive tasks?
- What does abundance look like when filtered through wisdom and play rather than optimization?
- Can experimental protocols really transmute civilizational crisis into renaissance?
- What happens when "taking play seriously" becomes a serious cultural force?
- How does the art of context appreciation change when context itself becomes malleable?

The Context Appreciation Society of 2030 doesn't just study these questions—it lives them, with all the beautiful chaos that entails.
