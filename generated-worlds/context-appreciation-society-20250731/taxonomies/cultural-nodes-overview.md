# Cultural-Nodes - Taxonomy Overview

## Description
Physical and virtual spaces where the Context Appreciation Society operates, from flagship locations to experimental pop-ups

## Entry Guidelines for Cultural-Nodes
These guidelines provide a flexible framework - adapt sections as needed for each entry's unique story.

### Core Elements (Include Most)
- **Space & Architecture** - The physical or virtual design, location, atmosphere, and how the space shapes the activities within it (flexible for purely digital or hybrid spaces)
- **Community & Culture** - Who gathers there, what kinds of activities happen, the social dynamics and cultural practices that have emerged (adapt for different scales of community)
- **Signature Programs** - The distinctive activities, events, or practices that define this node's contribution to the Society (scale based on the node's specialization)
- **Evolution & Impact** - How the space has changed over time, its influence on the broader Society, and its role in the network of nodes (flexible for new vs established nodes)

### Additional Elements (Use When Relevant)
- **Origin Story** - When the founding or early history of the space is particularly significant or interesting
- **Challenges & Conflicts** - When the node has faced significant obstacles, controversies, or internal tensions
- **Innovation & Experiments** - When the node has pioneered new practices, technologies, or approaches that spread to other locations
- **Connections & Network** - When the node's relationships with other spaces, organizations, or movements are particularly significant

## Writing Guidelines
- **Length**: Target 400-500 words for initial entries (expand for major flagship locations)
- **Voice**: Create a sense of place - help readers feel the atmosphere and understand why this space matters
- **Style**: Mix architectural/spatial description with social observation - show how space and community interact
- **Connections**: Reference key figures who frequent the space, events that happened there, and protocols practiced there
- **Personality**: Each node should feel distinctive with its own character, energy, and cultural flavor

## Content Approach
- Include sensory details that bring the space to life - sounds, smells, visual elements, energy
- Show the space in action rather than just describing static features
- Capture the human experience of being in this space and participating in its community
- Write with awareness of how physical/virtual environments shape consciousness and social interaction
- Balance the practical with the poetic - show both function and feeling

## Writing Philosophy
These guidelines serve as flexible frameworks rather than rigid templates. Each entry should be crafted to tell its unique story while maintaining consistency with the world's established tone and feel. Prioritize engaging, immersive writing that brings each element to life through vivid details, interesting perspectives, and natural connections to other world elements.
