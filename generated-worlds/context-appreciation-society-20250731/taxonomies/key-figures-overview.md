## Entry Guidelines for Key-Figures
These guidelines provide a flexible framework - adapt sections as needed for each entry's unique story.

### Core Elements (Include Most)
- **Origin Story** - How they first encountered the Context Appreciation Society, their background before involvement (with flexibility for mysterious figures or gradual reveals)
- **Signature Contributions** - Their unique impact on the Society's evolution, key innovations, protocols, or insights they brought (adapt scope based on their influence level)
- **Defining Moments** - Pivotal events, breakthrough moments, or controversies that shaped their role and the Society's direction (can be single dramatic events or accumulating patterns)

### Additional Elements (Use When Relevant)
- **Philosophical Stance** - When their worldview or approach meaningfully differs from or shapes Society thinking
- **Conflicts & Controversies** - When they were involved in significant disputes, schisms, or resistance movements within or against the Society
- **Personal Quirks & Style** - When distinctive personality traits, habits, or approaches add color and memorability to their story
- **Legacy & Influence** - When their impact extends beyond direct contributions to shape ongoing practices, debates, or cultural evolution

## Writing Guidelines
- **Length**: Target 400-600 words for initial entries (expand if the story demands it)
- **Voice**: Favor engaging, immersive writing over bland biographical description
- **Style**: Mix documentary precision with narrative flair - include quotes, in-world documents, conflicting accounts, interesting perspectives
- **Connections**: Weave in references to other figures, events, and Society developments naturally
- **Personality**: Each entry should feel distinctive and memorable, capturing what made this person unique

## Content Approach
- Use in-world quotes, meeting transcripts, or observational accounts when they enhance the entry
- Include specific, vivid details that bring the person to life beyond their formal contributions
- Show relationships, rivalries, and collaborations rather than just listing them
- Write from interesting angles - a colleague's memoir, a critic's assessment, conflicting historical accounts
- Make each entry feel like it captures a real person with complexity, contradictions, and humanity

## Writing Philosophy
These guidelines serve as flexible frameworks rather than rigid templates. Each entry should be crafted to tell its unique story while maintaining consistency with the world's established tone and feel. Prioritize engaging, immersive writing that brings each element to life through vivid details, interesting perspectives, and natural connections to other world elements.
