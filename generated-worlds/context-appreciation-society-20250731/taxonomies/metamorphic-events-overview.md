# Metamorphic-Events - Taxonomy Overview

## Description
Pivotal moments, crises, breakthroughs, and parties that transformed the Society and broader culture

## Entry Guidelines for Metamorphic-Events
These guidelines provide a flexible framework - adapt sections as needed for each entry's unique story.

### Core Elements (Include Most)
- **Setting the Scene** - The context, time period, and circumstances that led to this pivotal moment (flexible for gradual buildups vs sudden eruptions)
- **The Event Unfolds** - What actually happened, key moments, turning points, and the sequence of transformative actions (adapt pacing for different event types)
- **Key Players & Reactions** - Who was involved, how different factions responded, immediate reactions and decisions made (scale based on event scope)
- **Transformation & Impact** - How this event changed the Society, broader culture, or individual lives, both immediate and long-term effects (flexible for ongoing vs completed transformations)

### Additional Elements (Use When Relevant)
- **Conflicting Accounts** - When there are multiple versions of what happened, disputed interpretations, or mysterious aspects that remain unclear
- **Ripple Effects** - When the event triggered a cascade of subsequent changes, inspired copycat events, or created new possibilities/problems
- **Symbolic Significance** - When the event became legendary, mythologized, or represents deeper cultural shifts beyond its literal occurrence
- **Documentation & Evidence** - When there are interesting artifacts, recordings, manifestos, or other materials that capture the event's essence

## Writing Guidelines
- **Length**: Target 400-600 words for initial entries (expand for complex multi-part events)
- **Voice**: Favor dramatic, immersive storytelling that captures the transformative energy of pivotal moments
- **Style**: Mix eyewitness accounts, historical analysis, and narrative tension - make readers feel the significance unfolding
- **Connections**: Show how events relate to key figures, cultural movements, and other transformative moments
- **Personality**: Each event should feel unique and memorable, with its own character and atmosphere

## Content Approach
- Use multiple perspectives when they illuminate different aspects of the transformation
- Include specific, visceral details that put readers in the moment
- Show the before/after contrast to emphasize the metamorphic nature
- Write with awareness that these events reshaped history - give them appropriate weight
- Balance the dramatic with the analytical to show both experience and significance

## Writing Philosophy
These guidelines serve as flexible frameworks rather than rigid templates. Each entry should be crafted to tell its unique story while maintaining consistency with the world's established tone and feel. Prioritize engaging, immersive writing that brings each element to life through vivid details, interesting perspectives, and natural connections to other world elements.
