# Protocol-Families - Taxonomy Overview

## Description
The various evolved forms of interaction design and human-AI interface protocols developed by the Society

## Entry Guidelines for Protocol-Families
These guidelines provide a flexible framework - adapt sections as needed for each entry's unique story.

### Core Elements (Include Most)
- **Protocol Origins** - How this family of practices emerged, who developed it, what problem or opportunity it addressed (flexible for mysterious origins or collective development)
- **Core Mechanics** - The fundamental techniques, steps, or approaches that define this protocol family (adapt complexity based on the protocol's sophistication)
- **Practical Applications** - How these protocols are actually used, what situations they're designed for, who practices them (scale based on adoption level)
- **Evolution & Variants** - How the protocols have changed over time, different schools or approaches within the family (flexible for stable vs rapidly evolving protocols)

### Additional Elements (Use When Relevant)
- **Training & Mastery** - When there are specific skill development paths, certification processes, or levels of expertise
- **Risks & Controversies** - When protocols involve significant dangers, ethical debates, or have been misused or banned
- **Cultural Impact** - When protocols have influenced broader society, inspired art/literature, or changed how people think
- **Technical Requirements** - When protocols require specific technologies, AI systems, or environmental conditions

## Writing Guidelines
- **Length**: Target 400-500 words for initial entries (expand for complex protocol families)
- **Voice**: Balance technical precision with accessible explanation - make protocols understandable but not oversimplified
- **Style**: Mix instructional clarity with narrative interest - include examples, case studies, or practitioner experiences
- **Connections**: Show relationships to other protocols, key figures who developed them, and events where they were significant
- **Personality**: Each protocol family should feel distinctive with its own philosophy and aesthetic

## Content Approach
- Include specific examples of protocols in action when they illuminate the approach
- Show the human experience of using these protocols, not just abstract descriptions
- Explain both the intended effects and unexpected outcomes or discoveries
- Write with awareness that these are living practices that continue to evolve
- Balance the practical with the philosophical - show both how and why these protocols matter

## Writing Philosophy
These guidelines serve as flexible frameworks rather than rigid templates. Each entry should be crafted to tell its unique story while maintaining consistency with the world's established tone and feel. Prioritize engaging, immersive writing that brings each element to life through vivid details, interesting perspectives, and natural connections to other world elements.
