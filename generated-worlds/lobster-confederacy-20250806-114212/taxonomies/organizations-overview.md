## Writing Guidelines
- **Length**: Target 300-400 words for initial entries (expand if the story demands it)
- **Voice**: Favor engaging, immersive writing over bland description
- **Style**: Mix documentary precision with narrative flair - include quotes, in-world documents, interesting perspectives

- **Personality**: Each entry should feel distinctive and memorable

## Content Approach
- Use in-world quotes, documents, or observations when they enhance the entry
- Include specific, vivid details that bring the element to life
- Show relationships and conflicts rather than just listing them
- Write from interesting angles - a scholar's notes, a traveler's account, conflicting reports
- Make each entry feel like it has personality and history

## Writing Philosophy
These guidelines serve as flexible frameworks rather than rigid templates. Each entry should be crafted to tell its unique story while maintaining consistency with the world's established tone and feel. Prioritize engaging, immersive writing that brings each element to life through vivid details, interesting perspectives, and natural connections to other world elements.
