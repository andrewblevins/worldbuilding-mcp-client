## Entry Guidelines for Politics
These guidelines provide a flexible framework - adapt sections as needed for each entry's unique story.

### Core Elements (Include Most)
- **Core Issue & Stakes** - The fundamental political question or challenge, what's at stake for lobster society, competing perspectives expressed in flowery rhetoric
- **Key Players & Positions** - Major political figures involved, their stances, the eloquent arguments they make, factional alignments
- **Current Status & Developments** - Where things stand now, recent legislative actions, ongoing debates, procedural battles in formal chambers
- **Historical Context** - How this issue developed, past attempts at resolution, precedent-setting cases or speeches that shaped the discourse

### Additional Elements (Use When Relevant)
- **Procedural Details** - How the political system handles this issue, committee structures, formal debate protocols, voting mechanisms
- **Public Opinion & Pressure** - How ordinary lobster citizens view the issue, influence of social clubs, grassroots movements or formal petitions
- **Rhetoric & Notable Quotes** - Memorable speeches, famous exchanges of formal discourse, catchphrases that define the debate
- **Broader Implications** - How resolution might change lobster society, connections to other political issues, potential long-term consequences

## Writing Guidelines
- **Length**: Target 300-400 words for initial entries (expand if the story demands it)
- **Voice**: Favor engaging, immersive writing over bland description
- **Style**: Mix documentary precision with narrative flair - include quotes, in-world documents, interesting perspectives
- **Connections**: Weave in references to existing entries naturally
- **Personality**: Each entry should feel distinctive and memorable

## Content Approach
- Use in-world quotes, documents, or observations when they enhance the entry
- Include specific, vivid details that bring the element to life
- Show relationships and conflicts rather than just listing them
- Write from interesting angles - a scholar's notes, a traveler's account, conflicting reports
- Make each entry feel like it has personality and history

## Writing Philosophy
These guidelines serve as flexible frameworks rather than rigid templates. Each entry should be crafted to tell its unique story while maintaining consistency with the world's established tone and feel. Prioritize engaging, immersive writing that brings each element to life through vivid details, interesting perspectives, and natural connections to other world elements.
