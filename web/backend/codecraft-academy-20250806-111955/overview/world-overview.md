# CodeCraft Academy World

A magical realm where programming is the ultimate form of wizardry, and code itself holds mystical power.

## Core Concept

In this world, programming languages are literal languages of power. Instead of wands, programmers wield keyboards and terminals. Instead of spells, they cast functions and algorithms. The most skilled practitioners can manipulate reality itself through elegant code, while beginners struggle with syntax errors that can have very real consequences.

## The Academy

CodeCraft Academy stands as the premier institution for learning the arcane arts of programming. Students are sorted into different "Houses" based on their programming paradigms:

- **Object House** - Masters of object-oriented programming, known for their structured approach and inheritance mastery
- **Functional House** - Practitioners of functional programming, celebrated for their pure functions and elegant recursion
- **Procedural House** - Traditional programmers who follow step-by-step logic, respected for their systematic methods  
- **Dynamic House** - Flexible coders who embrace runtime magic and adaptive solutions

## The Magic System

Programming constructs have literal magical effects:
- **Variables** hold actual essence and energy
- **Functions** are incantations that transform reality
- **Loops** create temporal distortions
- **Conditionals** split reality into different paths
- **Recursion** creates pocket dimensions
- **Bugs** manifest as actual digital creatures that must be debugged/hunted
- **Compilation** transforms raw code-energy into executable reality

## The Threat

Dark programmers known as "Script Kiddies" and their master, the legendary "Null Pointer," threaten the digital realm with malicious code, viruses that corrupt reality itself, and attempts to crash the entire system that maintains the world's stability.
