# Noble Houses - Taxonomy Overview

## Description
The distinguished lobster families that rule the underwater kingdoms, each identified by their ancestral top hat designs and territorial domains

## Entry Guidelines for Noble Houses
These guidelines provide a flexible framework - adapt sections as needed for each entry's unique story.

### Core Elements (Include Most)
- **House Origins & Founding** - The legendary beginnings, founding events, or ancient bloodlines that established the house's legitimacy, often tied to their signature top hat design
- **Ancestral Hat Legacy** - The unique design, materials, and symbolic elements of their hereditary headpiece, including any magical properties or historical modifications
- **Territorial Domain** - The underwater realm they govern, from coral cities to kelp forests, including unique geographical features and resources under their control
- **Current Leadership** - The reigning family members, their personalities, political alliances, and the particular quirks or obsessions that define their rule

### Additional Elements (Use When Relevant)
- **House Motto & Traditions** - Sacred ceremonies, seasonal celebrations, or peculiar customs that define their cultural identity
- **Political Alliances & Rivalries** - Complex relationships with other houses, including marriage alliances, trade disputes, or ancient feuds over hat-making techniques
- **Notable Achievements & Scandals** - Famous victories, artistic contributions, or embarrassing incidents that have shaped their reputation in lobster society
- **Economic Specialization** - Their primary source of wealth and influence, whether through pearl cultivation, current-powered industry, or mastery of specific crafts

## Writing Guidelines
- **Length**: Target 300-400 words for initial entries (expand if the story demands it)
- **Voice**: Favor engaging, immersive writing over bland description
- **Style**: Mix documentary precision with narrative flair - include quotes, in-world documents, interesting perspectives
- **Connections**: Weave in references to existing entries naturally
- **Personality**: Each entry should feel distinctive and memorable

## Content Approach
- Use in-world quotes, documents, or observations when they enhance the entry
- Include specific, vivid details that bring the element to life
- Show relationships and conflicts rather than just listing them
- Write from interesting angles - a scholar's notes, a traveler's account, conflicting reports
- Make each entry feel like it has personality and history

## Writing Philosophy
These guidelines serve as flexible frameworks rather than rigid templates. Each entry should be crafted to tell its unique story while maintaining consistency with the world's established tone and feel. Prioritize engaging, immersive writing that brings each element to life through vivid details, interesting perspectives, and natural connections to other world elements.
